Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
In this Python project I have reanalyzed the medical data Semmelweis collected.

Our client is a credit card company. They have brought us a dataset that includes some demographics and recent financial data (the past six months) for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders.
In this Machine Learning project I have built a model to determine whether in the next month after a six month historical data period, an account owner has defaulted, or in other words, failed to make the minimum payment.

# Final Project
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

A lot of recent progress has been made towards developing computer vision systems that translate sign language to spoken language. This technology often relies on complex neural network architectures that can detect subtle patterns in streaming video. However, as a first step, towards understanding how to build a translation system, we can reduce the size of the problem by translating individual letters, instead of sentences.

In this notebook, we will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, we will train the network and test its performance.
