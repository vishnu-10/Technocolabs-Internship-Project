Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
In this Python project I have reanalyzed the medical data Semmelweis collected.

Our client is a credit card company. They have brought us a dataset that includes some demographics and recent financial data (the past six months) for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders.
In this Machine Learning project I have built a model to determine whether in the next month after a six month historical data period, an account owner has defaulted, or in other words, failed to make the minimum payment.
